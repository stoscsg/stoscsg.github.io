      <p>Our Sunday school has always been an essential part of the spiritual life of our Cathedral because we believe that our children are our future. We have about 125 students enrolled in classes ranging from Kindergarten through Grade 10. The curriculum
        includes:
        <br />
        <br /> Textbooks recommended for the Orthodox Syrian Churches
        <br /> Children
        <br /> Worksheets to go with the textbooks
        <br /> Learning the Bible
        <br /> Learning Christian songs
        <br /> Learning the hymns sung in Church</p>

      <p>Every Sunday, after the Holy Qurbana, the Sunday school runs for an hour, from 11:00 am to 12 noon. The first half hour is devoted to learning songs, Bible Verses and understanding the Bible through short stories. Individual classes are held duringthe next half an hour. At present we have 13 teachers, including 5 relief teachers. </p>

      <p>We have different activities throughout the year. The children from the higher grades are encouraged to participate in the Youth Camp held every year jointly with our sister cathedral from Malaysia.</p>

      <p>The main objectives of the Sunday school are:</p>

      <p>Spiritual growth of the individual student with particular emphasis on the Bible
        <br /> Nurture in a Bible-based Orthodox Christian tradition, with the involvement of the entire Church community</p>
