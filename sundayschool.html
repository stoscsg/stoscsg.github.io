      <p>The Sunday School is a spiritual organization held in all the parishes of the Orthodox Church throughout the world. It spiritually nurtures our children, by bringing them up in the knowledge and fellowship of Jesus Christ and His Church. The classes range from Pre-primary classes to the 12th class. As in secular schools, class ten concludes the secondary level and a certificate is awarded â€“Sunday School final Certificate (SSFC) to the successful candidates. Higher Secondary course is for another tow years. We follow a curriculum, jointly prepared and published by the Oriental Orthodox Churches which is revised from time to time. The vacation Bible School conducted during the mid summer holidays (OVBS) is a very vibrant wing of the O.S.S.A.E. (Orthodox Syrian Sunday School Association of the East).</P>

<p>Our Sunday school has always been an essential part of the spiritual life of our Cathedral because we believe that our children are our future. We have about 125 students enrolled in classes ranging from Kindergarten through Grade 10. The curriculum
        includes:
        <br />
        <br /> Textbooks recommended for the Orthodox Syrian Churches
        <br /> Children
        <br /> Worksheets to go with the textbooks
        <br /> Learning the Bible
        <br /> Learning Christian songs
        <br /> Learning the hymns sung in Church</p>

      <p>Every Sunday, after the Holy Qurbana, the Sunday school runs for an hour, from 11:00 am to 12 noon. The first half hour is devoted to learning songs, Bible Verses and understanding the Bible through short stories. Individual classes are held duringthe next half an hour. At present we have 13 teachers, including 5 relief teachers. </p>

      <p>We have different activities throughout the year. The children from the higher grades are encouraged to participate in the Youth Camp held every year jointly with our sister cathedral from Malaysia.</p>

      <p>The main objectives of the Sunday school are:</p>

      <p>Spiritual growth of the individual student with particular emphasis on the Bible
        <br /> Nurture in a Bible-based Orthodox Christian tradition, with the involvement of the entire Church community</p>
