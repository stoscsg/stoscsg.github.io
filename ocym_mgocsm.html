      <p>The Orthodox Christian Youth Movement (OCYM), the Youth-wing of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church is in its 71st year of active leadership and Christian witness in the Church and society. It contributes to the goodness and progress of the Church and community in the three-fold path of worship, study and service. It aims at moulding the minds and visions of the youth against the background of the contemporary issues. OCYM wing of our parish is a gathering of youth aged between 20 and 45 years and it is the spiritual platform for demonstrating the talents of the young blood.</p>
