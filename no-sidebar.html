				<p>St. Thomas Orthodox Syrian Cathedral, Singapore is a parish of the Chennai Diocese of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church of India. We inherit the untainted apostolic faith from Apostle St. Thomas which has been upheld and preserved with reverence for generations.</p>

				<p>The first seed of Orthodox Syrian Church was laid in Singapore when our forefathers under the British colonial rule conducted Holy Eucharist in March 1928. Our numbers increased over the years and in 1958 we built our own church at Topaz Road. The church moved to its present location in Yio Chu Kang Road in 1983 and was elevated to cathedral status in 1997.</p>

				<p>St. Thomas Orthodox Syrian Cathedral provides opportunities for people to worship God. Our worship includes praise, thanksgiving, confession, petition, reading of the Scriptures, and dedication. The Holy Eucharist is offered every Sunday in Malayalam and English alternatively and all the faithful are encouraged to take part in it. The church has St. Maryâ€™s League, Youth League and Sunday school and regularly conducts Bible study classes, retreats, evangelistic meetings, social and charitable activities.</p>

				<p>The parish with a strength of more than 200 families grows in faith day by day by the grace of God Almighty and the intercession of St. Mary, St. Thomas and all other saints. We cordially welcome you all to visit our cathedral.</p>
